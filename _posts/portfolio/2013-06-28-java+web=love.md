In 2011-2013 I worked at [Digital Zone] company, the main project there was [Ulmart]. My main contribution includes:

* New database structure for Ulmart 2.0 which was based on [MySQL].
* Fast catalog of goods which showed great performance under high load. Technologies like [Spring Framework], [JSP] and eventually [FreeMarker] were used.
* The search platform that was created by using [Apache Solr].
