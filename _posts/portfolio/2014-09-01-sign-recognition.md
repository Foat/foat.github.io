In [RoadAR] company I have developed a fast algorithm for traffic sign detection and recognition
which works in real-time on mobile phones.

The algorithm is written on C++ and it supports most of Russian round and triangular signs.

You can find an application where this algorithm is used in [Google Play].

This is one of the previews of the [RoadAR] application:
