## Experience

|
-|-:
**Self-employed**        | *Worldwide*
Senior software engineer | *February 2015 --- PRESENT*

Working on several projects including my own. Other notable projects:

* Wrote some software developments articles on a personal website: [foat.me](http://foat.me). It mostly includes Scala articles.
* Contributed to a complex multi-threaded trading system. 
* Wrote a book in the fields of computer vision and web development: [[1]](#publications).
* Designed and implemented robust and fast algorithm for multiply chalkboard detection. It works in real-time and processes more than 40 HD images per second on a regular computer. The pixel precision is higher than 90%.
* Created a Java throttling framework from scratch using Spring MVC and AspectJ.
